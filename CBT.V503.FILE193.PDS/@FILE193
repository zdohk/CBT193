//***FILE 193 is from Steinar Aasland, formerly of Kvaerner         *   FILE 193
//*           Engineering in Lysaker, Norway, and contains a        *   FILE 193
//*           tape copying program called TCOPY.  This is an        *   FILE 193
//*           old program.                                          *   FILE 193

//*           This program can list the contents of a tape, or      *   FILE 193
//*           copy it to another tape.  It has some features that   *   FILE 193
//*           are not so often found in tape copy programs.         *   FILE 193

//*           Fixed to be able to copy 64K block size on a tape,    *   FILE 193
//*           by Sam Golob.  Also cleaned up some assembly errors   *   FILE 193
//*           for ASMA90.  The macro processor is now a little      *   FILE 193
//*           less forgiving.  Shorter strings now always compare   *   FILE 193
//*           as less, so to be accurate, you have to pad them      *   FILE 193
//*           to the same length.                                   *   FILE 193
